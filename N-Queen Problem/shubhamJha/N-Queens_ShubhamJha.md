"I have Choosed "Java and Python Language"  to solve the N-Queens Puzzle Problem by Backtracking"


-> Because I find that to get best performace of our code implementation and approaches must be there in as many language as we can,
and these implementations finds optimum and efficient code.

-> In backtracking, we first take a step and then we see if this step taken is correct or not i.e., whether it will give a correct answer 
or not. And if it doesnâ€™t, then we just come back and change our first step. In general, this is accomplished by recursion. Thus, in backtracking,
we first start with a partial sub-solution of the problem (which may or may not lead us to the solution) and then check if we can proceed further
with this sub-solution or not. If not, then we just come back and change it.

- the general steps of backtracking are:

1. start with a sub-solution
2. check if this sub-solution will lead to the solution or not
3. If not, then come back and change the sub-solution and continue again

-> In N-Queens Puzzle we have Followed these steps:

1. we will start by placing the first queen.
2. the second step is to place the second queen in a safe position and then the third queen.
3. we will just change the position of the previous queen. And this is backtracking.Also, there is no other position
where we can place the third queen so we will go back one more step and change the position of the second queen.
4. we will place the third queen again in a safe position until we find a solution.
5. We will continue this process and finally, we will get the solution.
