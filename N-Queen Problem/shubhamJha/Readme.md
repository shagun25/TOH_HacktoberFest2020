# N Queen Problem

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

or we can say <br>
N - Queens problem is to place n - queens in such a manner on an n x n chessboard that no queens attack each other by being in the same row, column or diagonal.

It can be seen that for n =1, the problem has a trivial solution, and no solution exists for n =2 and n =3. So first we will consider the 4 queens problem and then generate it to n - queens problem.

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space respectively.
